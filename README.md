# Detection of COVID-19 Using X-Ray Images

It is aimed to classify the chest X-ray images that corresponds to coronavirus disease.  ResNet, one of the most successful image processing models to date, will be used for this purpose. Since the data is quite imbalanced, apart from accuracy, confusion matrix and ROC curve were also used for the sake of measuring the success of the models properly. Also, preprocessing and solving the imbalanced data problem constitutes an important part of this classification task.

## The Data

The .csv files are hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/praveengovi/coronahack-chest-xraydataset), where a description of the datasets can also be found.
